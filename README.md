There are two sets of data 
  The first is price data, which is available in a Python data structure called a dictionary. 
  This dictionary has been named item_dict, and it stores the price of each item that is available in the store.
  The second is the Transaction data, which is available as an array of arrays. 
  Each row corresponds to one transaction. 
  For example, in the table below, the second transaction consists of burgers, meatballs, and eggs. For future reference, this will be called transaction data.
